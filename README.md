# Description:  
This website was meant to feature one of our vendors and show the products they have available.  

I used a jQuery plugin carousel called [Flexslider by WooThemes - http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/) on the rotating banner up top.  I also used it in the middle section to feature one of their products and rotate to different images of it.
